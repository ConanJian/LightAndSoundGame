When building the logic for the code, I first started out using for loops.

I did this because I realized that I was going to build the entire sequence for how the game is suppose to be run.
So, like a true java developer who only needs to press the run button, I tried to build the entire thing, so that it would run with one click of the panel.
Few minutes later, I realize I call the code everytime I press the button so a for loop is a actually a problem.

I used log.console("Did this run") to see how far my code ran because I realized that the game would only work for 2 runs.

I realized that I was using pattern[progress] and progress wasn't being updated(I had this in the array because in the for loop I would update progress)
After that I tried to for loop the whole thing again only to quickly remember that doing a for loop makes no sense.
I thought about what variable I should use/ what var would work and I realized the guessCounter would work.
I replaced the var with guessCount and it failed to work because the var's name is guessCounter.

On the final run it worked and I checked my code only to find out I have typed(practically) the exact same code as you.

Which is why I have this paragraph as evidence that I made the whole function legitly and by myself.

The time it took to make this message is not included in my time for developing the webpage.
Also, the time it shows on my project is wrong because I just left the tab open, so that is it looks like
I've been on this project for forever
